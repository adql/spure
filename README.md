# Spure

_Spure_ (try it [here](https://adql.github.io/spure/)) is an ultra-minimalistic text editor. Not only that it doesn't let you edit what you have written, but it also hides it from you almost completely.

Previously I have prototyped it in [Racket](https://github.com/adql/spitter).

## Usage

Write your text in the text box. Except for corrections in the current word, you cannot make any changes!

When you're done, click the _Spure_ button. Your text will be displayed. You can save it and reset the app.

## License

The [deployed app](https://adql.github.io/spure/) is free for use. I currently work on this as a personal project without contributions and therefore don't release it under a license. This may change in the future.
